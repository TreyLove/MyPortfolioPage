 
 Project Name: Trey's Portfolio 

 Description:
 1. this is a mock up portfolio page for the second week of my UW bootcamp course.
 
 2. It contains responsive cards to place my future projects with a sticky sidebar 
    to help navigate through the website as I increase my portfolio size. as well as 
    a nav bar at the top to navigate to the about me section and contact sections in
    the footer. I intend to make these link to seperate webpages as I learn more about
    programming
 
 3. At the bottom I have placed a picture of myself as well as an about me and a 
    contact section to fill out as I get closer to actually using this portfolio 
    page to obtain employment.

 4. I created several breakpoints to make the website easily useable on a variety of screen 
    sizes
